    <h1>How Social Recovery Works</h1>

    <h3>Number of Shares</h3>
    <p>
      Select the number of shares that you wish to recover your secret from. This can be anywhere between 2 to 6. Make sure that this
      corresponds to the same number of shares that was initially selected when creating the shares
    </p>

    <h3>Entering a Share</h3>
    <p>
      Next, you'll be asked to enter the terms for each share. To do so, you can use the terms that are suggested or use our mnemonic secure
      keyboard. A share can consist of 24 terms. Make sure that you put the terms in the right order too
    </p>
    <h3>Enter All Shares</h3>
    <p>After one share has been entered successfully, youâ€™ll be asked to enter the next one until all shares have been entered</p>
